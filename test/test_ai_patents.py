Predicting viewable events will allow users to know what events will likely be viewable in a particular venue, such as a restaurant, bar, or private home.

A slip (or offset) may be introduced between processing nodes of a distributed processing system formed by a plurality of interconnected processing nodes, to enable faster nodes to continue processing without waiting for slower nodes to catch up. In certain aspects, a processing node, after completing each processing step, may check for received completion packets and apply a defined constraint to determine whether it may start processing a subsequent step or not."
