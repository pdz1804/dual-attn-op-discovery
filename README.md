# dual-attn-op-discovery
This repository is about using the Dual Attention model to extract keywords of a company based on its webpages and then using the Transformation Matrix to get the mapping between companies and patents. At the end, the user could find the patents or the companies that related to the technology that the user wants to find (during market research).
